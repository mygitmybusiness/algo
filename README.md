# üß† My Algorithm Journey

Welcome to my personal algorithms & data structures playground!  
This repo is my **digital notebook** for solving problems, exploring patterns, and sharpening my problem-solving skills ‚Äî one algorithm at a time.

## üí° Why I Do This

I've always been fascinated by the elegance of algorithms ‚Äî the way a small, well-crafted idea can turn a messy problem into a neat, efficient solution.  
I see algorithms as a kind of mental gym ‚Äî every problem solved is like adding one more rep to my intellectual workout.

- **Understanding the core problem** before writing a single line of code
- **Exploring multiple solutions** and their trade-offs
- **Optimizing** for both clarity and performance
- **Recognizing patterns** that show up again and again

## üöÄ How I Work

- **Solve first, optimize later** ‚Äî start with a working brute force solution, then improve.
- **Explain it like I'm teaching** ‚Äî every solution includes comments & thought process.
- **Track progress** ‚Äî commit regularly, organize by topic.

## üèÜ Goal

By following this roadmap and consistently practicing, I aim to:

- Improve speed & accuracy in coding interviews
- Recognize patterns instantly
- Build a deeper intuition for problem-solving

This repo is about **becoming a better engineer**.
